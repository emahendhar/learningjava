Day 1:

Second Largest Element in an Array

Given an array of positive integers arr[] of size n, the task is to find second largest distinct element in the array.

Note: If the second largest element does not exist, return -1.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1,2]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 there is no second largest element.


Day 2:

Given an array of integers arr[], the task is to move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of all non-zero elements.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 6, 0, 5, 0]
Output: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 6, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 40]
Output: arr[] = [10, 20, 40]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: arr[] = [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
